# twitter-sentiment-analysis-NLP
twitter comments sentiment analysis using bag of words model (natural language processing) and Random Forest classification

The dataset was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis

The dataset was cleaned, removing all the irrelevant marked comments.

Then the reviews themselves were cleaned, keeping only the necessary words and applying stemming on them.

Then we trained the classification problem on Random Forest.
